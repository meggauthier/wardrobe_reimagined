      <p>When Carol and I got together for the first time, I had no idea what to expect. She made me feel comfortable enough to invite into my messy closet – with clothes from the 90’s taking up a bunch of space. Carol went through my closet, helping me decide what to keep or donate. She also did a color test to show me what colors look best on me. And then she coordinated outfits using the clothes I already had and gave me a list of items to purchase to make the pieces work better with my current clothes. Shopping has now become fun and more intentional after this process…no more shopping for random pieces that don’t go with anything. And I even took a bunch of the clothes I wasn’t wearing to a consignment store and sold them. Even simple things like separating tops and bottoms didn’t occur to me before I met you. Thank you for being so patient with me!

      <p>Carol's assistance has been invaluable and has helped me in so many ways.  Where I used to feel hopeless about my appearance, I now know what looks flattering on me and how to put together outfits that bring out my best features.  I'm saving money by no longer buying the wrong clothes that will just hang in my closet, and I leave the house feeling confident every day.  I would recommend Carol to anyone who is ready to make a change in her style but doesn't know where to start.  She is warm and approachable and makes the whole process fun, while helping you look your personal best.

      <p>Carol helped me feel confident and comfortable at a recent red carpet event for my organization, Save the Children.  I wanted to be on trend, but not trendy, and to strike a balance between stylish and professional.  Carol guided me to an elegant lace dress in a dark navy, “the new black.”  She advised me to keep my accessories simple – pearl drop earrings, a black satin clutch and patent pumps I could stand in for hours.  I felt the outfit was appropriate and flattering, and received numerous compliments throughout the evening.  I’ll definitely be asking for Carol’s advice in the future.

      <p> I am amazed at the difference it makes to clear out a wardrobe and learn how to dress well with a few select outfits. Thoroughly recommended!
